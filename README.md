# Particle-Generator
 I've created a web-based particle generator featuring fire, confetti, and fireworks animations, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently expanding it with a water effect. This project combines visual and audio elements for an engaging user experience.
# Features
Dynamic Backgrounds: Gradient backgrounds that set the mood for the celebration.
Interactive Toolbar: Allows users to trigger animations such as confetti, fireworks, fire, and water.
Custom Fonts and Icons: Utilizes custom fonts and SVG icons to enhance the user interface.
Sound Effects: Adds audio feedback to the animations for a more immersive experience.
# Setup and Usage
1. **Download/Clone the Project**

   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Launch a local server:
     - **Python 3.x**: `python -m http.server`
     - **Python 2.x**: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
   - Access the project at `http://localhost:8000`.
   - (Side Note: This is the most common method of locally hosting a website. Please refer to other methods online if you do not or cannot use python such as hosting through PHP, Node.js, etc.)
